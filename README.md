# Web application that support learning how to solve Rubik's cube

The application is based on displaying an interactive 3D Rubik's cube model. In addition, it allows you to save your scores, compare them with the scores of other users through the ranking and track your progress in stats page.

The application’s server was created using the .NET platform and C# language and it utilizes Entity Framework to communicate with the database. Authentication was carried out using JWT tokens. The web application was written in JavaScript, specifically with the use of the React.js. The cube’s model and its whole functionality was also done in the C# language, in the video game engine Unity. The Unity project was embedded into the web application using the UnityWebGL library, which allows Unity projects to run inside applications based on JavaScript.

Inside the front folder there is a readme with a list of used libraries.
